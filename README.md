# Waving_Hands
Simple implementation of the waving hands game. 

I'm eventually going to try writing a bot to play it which may or may not involve some sort of mahcine learning application.

Stuff to do:

finish spell list
add status effects to warlocks
add global effects to game
add monster adding to game
add turns to game (they're sort of implemented at the moment)
add a nice frontend for user input


There's plenty more but that will do for now.
